                              </ul><p>We love and appreciate big mature trees. However all too
                                often trees are not maintained properly resulting in dangerous
                                situations. We can enjoy living side by side with these green giants if we reduce the risk.
                                <p>This is done by reducing the height and spread of the tree canopy, thus reducing
                                the amount of wind resistance or ‘sail’ area of the tree itself.<br><p class="fill">click button up to get quote.</p>

              <p> Each tree is examined individually in relation to size, shape, age, condition, site and species.
                  All pruning is carried out with care and respect for the tree by qualified arborists
                  only.<br>
                   <p>Each branch is removed using the ABC cut method ensuring the branch collar remains intact.
                      Any large limbs are removed using ropes and slings. Controlled lowering of all material
                      is an integral feature of our work.
                      Formative pruning may also include ‘crown lifting’.
                   </p>This involves the removal of lower branches
                          to achieve a required height clearance from ground level to the first branch.
                          This is useful when it comes to obstructions to footpaths, lawns, roads, rooftops
                          and buildings.
                        </p> This is usually
                          carried out for trees which are growing too large for their position or may have
                          biomechanical structural faults. We also identify and remove dead or unstable
                          branches.

                    Although hedge trimming is usually carried out by gardeners, we have an
                    extensive client list for this service. We can trim small hedges
                     and shrubs to a neat and natural shape or we can also cut larger
                     overgrown hedges such as a row of conifers to a manageable height  Formative tree
                     pruning is the professional removal of branches from trees using

                  <br><br>practices that are approved to achieve a specific objective. During the early stages
                    of a tree’s growth cycle, minor pruning should be implemented to fix any found defects
                    or other defected ailments that may develop into an issue in its later life.
                    Effective pruning will promote new development and growth. If the tree is in a
                    healthy condition, it should respond well to this.

                      <br>Old decayed stems are removed along with bacterial infected diseased plants.
                      After these wounds have fully healed, further pruning will then stimulate
                      new growth and reshape the tree into a better form. We have a full workforce
                      of professionally trained tree surgeons to perform effective tree pruning
                      practices which are up to date with the latest regulations.<br><br> Our fleet is
                      fully equipped with modern equipment such as pole saws for difficult to
                      reach places and lightweight pruning saws for accurate close pruning.<br>

                      We adopt a clear systematic method of evaluating risk that helps ensure that the
                      best outcome and management decisions are reached.<br><br>
